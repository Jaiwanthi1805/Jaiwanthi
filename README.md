# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
This project explains a Simple Interest Calculator, which is used to calculate the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

Simple interest is calculated using a standard mathematical formula and is commonly used in basic financial calculations.

## Formula
Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest (per year)
- T = Time period (in years)

## Example
If the principal amount is 1000, the rate of interest is 5%, and the time period is 2 years:

SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100  
SI = 100

So, the simple interest is 100.

## Usage
This calculator helps users understand how simple interest is calculated and can be used for educational purposes.
